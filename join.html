            <h2>Join Our Mission</h2>
            <div class="join-content">
                <p>At the Initiative for Leadership Development & Change (ILDC), we believe that true transformation begins when people come together to make a difference. Every child who receives a school book, every family whose meals are secured, every patient who receives life-saving care is a story of hope, courage, and the power of collective action.</p>
                <p>We invite individuals, organizations, and businesses to join us in empowering Nigeria's future leaders and uplifting communities. Through leadership development, humanitarian service, and community engagement, we strive to create opportunities that break cycles of poverty, build resilience, and inspire lasting change.</p>
                <p>Humanitarian work is at the heart of everything we do. Our volunteers and partners dedicate their time, energy, and resources to bring hope where it is needed most—whether by providing educational materials to children who dream of a brighter future, organizing food drives to feed struggling families, conducting medical outreaches in underserved communities, or leading environmental clean-up projects that protect our neighborhoods. Each effort, no matter how small, carries the potential to transform lives.</p>
                <p>When you join ILDC, you are not just supporting a program—you are becoming part of a movement that touches hearts and changes lives. Your time, resources, and partnership allow us to reach further, act faster, and deepen our impact across Nigeria. Together, we can nurture leaders, heal communities, and build a future where every Nigerian has the chance to thrive.</p>
                <p>Stand with us today. Help us write more stories of hope, opportunity, and transformation.</p>

                <p>Mosquito-borne diseases, especially malaria, continue to threaten millions of lives in Nigeria. Most severely children under five and pregnant women. ILDC is committed to reducing this burden through mosquito eradication initiatives, including the distribution of insecticide-treated nets, access to anti-malarial medications, medical outreach, and community sanitation programs.</p>

                    <h3>How Far Your Support Can Go</h3>
                    <p>Every cup of clean water a child drinks, every harvest preserved instead of wasted, and every family spared from hunger and disease begins with your kindness.</p>
                    <p>₦2,000 helps provide safe water and hygiene supplies for a household, protecting children from waterborne diseases</p>
                    <p>₦5,000 supports food preservation, hygiene education, and safe handling practices for vulnerable families</p>
                    <p>₦20,000 delivers sanitation materials, hand-washing facilities, and food-processing support to at-risk households</p>
                    <p>For deeper, life-changing impact:</p>
                    <p>₦1,000,000 transforms an entire community with clean water access, sanitation facilities, and food-processing support—protecting hundreds of families</p>
                    <p>₦50,000,000 equips multiple rural communities with boreholes, toilets, hygiene systems, and solar-powered food-processing centers</p>
                    <p>₦500,000,000 powers a nationwide WASH and food-security initiative, reducing hunger, disease, and post-harvest losses across Nigeria</p>
                    <p>₦1,000,000,000 builds a lasting legacy—sustainable water, sanitation, and food-processing infrastructure that secures health, dignity, and livelihoods for generations</p>
                    <p>No child should drink unsafe water. No farmer should lose a harvest to waste. No family should choose between hunger and illness. Your gift—no matter the size—brings health, dignity, and hope to communities that need it most.</p>
