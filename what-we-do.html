                <h2>Our Impact</h2>

            <h2>We Provide Clean Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH)</h2>
            <div class="mosquito-content">
                <p>Access to clean water and proper sanitation remains a critical challenge for millions of Nigerians, especially in rural communities. Unsafe water and poor hygiene contribute to preventable diseases like cholera, typhoid, and dysentery, threatening the health and well-being of children and families. <br> 
                    ILDC is committed to transforming communities through Clean Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) initiatives, including the construction of boreholes and safe drinking water systems, installation of toilets and hand-washing stations, and the delivery of hygiene education programs.</p>
                <p>Your donation helps us provide safe water, promote healthy habits, and protect vulnerable communities from life-threatening illnesses. Together, we can build healthier, stronger futures for every family. Support the cause. Donate today and bring clean water to those who need it most.</p>
                
                <h2>We Provide Food Processing Centers</h2>
                <p>Food insecurity and post-harvest losses remain major humanitarian challenges in Nigeria, disproportionately affecting smallholder farmers, women, children, and rural communities. Despite abundant agricultural production, millions of households lack access to safe, affordable, and nutritious food due to poor processing, storage, and market infrastructure.
                    The Food Processing Centers initiative addresses this gap by establishing community-based, solar-powered processing hubs across Nigeria. These centers will enable farmers to safely process, preserve, and package key staple foods such as cassava, palm products, and beans, significantly reducing food waste while improving quality, shelf life, and food safety.</p>
                <p>Beyond infrastructure, the project prioritizes community empowerment through training, with a strong focus on women and youth. By strengthening local value chains and improving incomes, the initiative supports long-term food security, livelihoods, and resilience rather than short-term relief.
                    Through sustainable energy use, clean water access, and inclusive participation, the ILDC Food Processing Centers project offers a practical, scalable humanitarian solution that tackles the root causes of hunger and poverty while building resilient food systems across Nigeria.  Partner with us by Donating today and help build resilient communities with reliable food, better livelihoods, and brighter futures.</p>
